Using Python to build a Black Jack User vs Dealer Game

The Objective of Blackjack is to beat the Dealer / Computer.
Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.

There are some misconceptions about the objective of the game of blackjack but at the simplest level all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.

How do you beat the dealer?

By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value
By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

How do you lose to the dealer? 

Your hand value exceeds 21.
The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round
